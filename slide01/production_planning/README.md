- 4 types of fertilisers whose processing is carried out by two departments

|                       | Type 1 | Type 2  | Type 3  | Type 4  |
|-----------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| production department | 2  h   | 1.5  h  | 0.5   h | 2.5   h |
| packing department    | 0.5 h  | 0.25  h | 0.25 h  | 1   h   |

|        | Type 1 | Type 2 | Type 3 | Type 4 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| profit | 250    | 230    | 110    | 350    |

What type of problem is this? I'm pretty sure that is an assignment problem.
