# 0-1 Knapsack problem

Suppose you are planning a
picnic. Youâ€™ve constructed a list
of items you would like to carry
with you on the picnic. Each
item has a weight associated
with it and your knapsack is
limited to carrying no more than
15 pounds. You have also come
up with a 1 to 10 rating for each
item, which indicates how
strongly you want to include the
particular item in the knapsack
for the picnic. This information
is listed in the next table.

| Item          | Weight | Rating |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Ant repellent | 1      | 2      |
| Beer          | 3      | 9      |
| Blanket       | 4      | 3      |
| Bratwurst     | 3      | 8      |
| Brownies      | 3      | 10     |
| Frisbee       | 1      | 6      |
| Salad         | 5      | 4      |
| Watermelon    | 10     | 10     |
